Circular Queue:

A circular queue is an extension of a regular queue data structure, where the last element is connected to the first element, forming a circle. This circular arrangement allows for better space utilization in scenarios where the queue needs to be operated in a cyclic manner. The circular queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, and the key operations include enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

Key Characteristics:

Front and Rear Pointers:

Front: Points to the front (first) element of the circular queue.
Rear: Points to the rear (last) element of the circular queue.
Circular Arrangement:

After reaching the end of the array, the rear pointer wraps around to the beginning, creating a circular arrangement.
Full and Empty Conditions:

The queue is considered full when (rear + 1) % N == front, where N is the size of the circular queue.
The queue is considered empty when front == -1.
Operations:

Enqueue:

Adds an element to the rear of the circular queue.
Rear pointer is incremented, and circular wrapping is applied.
Dequeue:

Removes an element from the front of the circular queue.
Front pointer is incremented, and circular wrapping is applied.
Peek (or Front):

Returns the element at the front of the circular queue without removing it.
Overflow and Underflow:

Overflow occurs when the circular queue is full.
Underflow occurs when trying to dequeue from an empty circular queue.
Implementation:

A circular queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list. In the array-based implementation, the indices of the front and rear pointers are adjusted using the modulo operation to create the circular effect.

Applications:

Buffer Management:

Circular queues are used in scenarios where elements are processed cyclically, such as in managing buffers in computer systems.
Task Scheduling:

In operating systems, circular queues are used for task scheduling, where processes are scheduled in a cyclic manner.
Print Queue:

Documents sent to a printer can be managed using a circular queue.
Memory Management:

Circular queues are used in managing free memory blocks in memory allocation algorithms.
Advantages:

Efficient Use of Space:

Circular queues efficiently utilize memory by allowing the last element to connect to the first.
Cyclic Processing:

Useful in scenarios where elements need to be processed in a cyclic manner.
Limitations:

Dynamic Size:

The size of a circular queue is typically fixed, which might be a limitation in dynamic scenarios.
Sequential Access:

Access to elements in a circular queue is sequential and not random, limiting certain use cases.
In summary, a circular queue is a variation of a regular queue with a circular arrangement that provides efficient space utilization and supports cyclic processing of elements. It finds applications in various fields such as computer systems, operating systems, and data management.
