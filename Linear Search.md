Linear Search:

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a straightforward search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a list or array. It checks each element of the list sequentially until a match is found or the entire list has been searched.

Algorithm Steps:

Start at the Beginning:

Begin searching from the start of the list.
Check Each Element:

For each element in the list, compare it with the target value.
Match Found or End of List:

If a match is found, return the index or position of the element.
If the end of the list is reached without finding a match, indicate that the element is not present.

Key Features:

Simple and Intuitive: Linear search is easy to understand and implement.

Works on Unsorted Data: Unlike some other search algorithms, linear search does not require the data to be sorted.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Use Cases:

Linear search is suitable for small lists or arrays.

It is applicable when the data is not sorted, and there is no specific order to exploit.

It is a basic algorithm used as a starting point in various algorithms and algorithms analysis.
