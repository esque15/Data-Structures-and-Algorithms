A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. The two primary operations associated with a stack are "push," which adds an element to the top of the stack, and "pop," which removes the element from the top of the stack.

Here are the basic operations associated with a stack:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
Peek (or Top): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it
